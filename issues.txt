## Summary Table

| Area              | Current State                                            | Recommendation                                        |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Structure         | Feature-based, logical, but some odd folder naming      | Use kebab-case or camelCase, avoid spaces in folders  |
| Data Management   | Hardcoded data everywhere                               | Use props/context/API, never hardcode real data       |
| Styling           | styled-components, mostly clean                         | Split styles if files grow; use consistent patterns   |
| Accessibility     | Some missing alt text/semantic elements                 | Add alt, use semantic HTML and keyboard navigation    |
| Performance       | Could be issues if data grows                           | Lazy load images, consider virtualization for lists   |
| Docs & Tests      | None found                                              | Add README, tests, and linting                        |
| Security          | No alerts, no secrets detected                          | Review before pushing, keep dependencies updated      |

## Actionable Next Steps

1. Refactor components to remove hardcoded data and use props/context/API.
2. Rename folders/files to avoid spaces; use kebab-case or camelCase.
3. Split large components into smaller, reusable ones.
4. Add a README, basic tests, and linting config (ESLint/Prettier).
5. Improve accessibility with semantic HTML and alt attributes.
6. Optimize images and consider lazy loading.
7. Set up license if open sourcing.
